Enemy release hypothesis	The absence of enemies in the exotic range is a cause of invasion success.	0
Biotic resistance hypothesis	An ecosystem with high biodiversity is more resistant against non-native species than an ecosystem with lower biodiversity.	1
Phenotypic plasticity hypothesis	Invasive species are more phenotypically plastic than non-invasive or native ones.	2
Darwins naturalization hypothesis	Invasion success of non-native species is higher in areas that are poor in closely related species than in areas that are rich in closely related species.	3
Island susceptibility hypothesis	Non-native species are more likely to become established and have major ecological impacts on islands than on continents.	4
Limiting similarity hypothesis	Success of non-native species is high if they strongly differ from native species, and it is low if they are similar to native species.	5
Propagule pressure hypothesis	High propagule pressure (a composite measure consisting of the number of individuals introduced per introduction event and the frequency of introduction events) is a cause of invasion success.	6
Disturbance hypothesis	Success of non-native species is higher in highly disturbed than in relatively undisturbed ecosystems.	7
Invasional meltdown hypothesis	The presence of non-native species in an ecosystem facilitates invasion by additional species, increasing their likelihood of survival or ecological impact.	8
Tens rule hypothesis	Approximately 10% of species successfully take consecutive steps of the invasion process.	9
